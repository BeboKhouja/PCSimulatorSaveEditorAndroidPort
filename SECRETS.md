We normally unlist videos about older versions of PC Simulator Save Editor Android if they appear on top to deter people from using older versions. Then later public it again.<br>
How I got banned from PC Simulator Discord:<br>

I suddenly got banned without warning.
It turns out that it could be:
1. Waldo and fsnopko made an alt and reported us, though this could be falsified.
2. An undercover mod banned me.

Message to Yiming:
Please lessen the restrictions about Rule 14, so that you wont get banned if you dont talk about cheating. This means that if you are popular in the hacking community, then you should not get banned for such thing, even though you didnt violate the rule.

So if you are at PCSim hecking community, or any server of PC Simulator hacking topic, please leave it. The Discord for this project is the only trusted one.

If we find out that a User is in PCSim Hacking community Discord or some sort, then we'll ban that User's account from the project immediately.

Also, N204's save editor (Verdix) got leaked, heres the download (could be malware): https://mega.nz/file/QABBkICD#Tjgjkwzn0S_5QDmJRDPhnzmczdWZ86W79ZzvWwn1M6U
