We normally unlist videos about older versions of PC Simulator Save Editor Android if they appear on top to deter people from using older versions. Then later public it again.<br>
How I got banned from PC Simulator Discord:<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc8d4c38-cb67-4bdb-8ed7-c713836aa316)<br>
I suddenly got banned without warning.
Reasons:
1. Android Studio Discord RPC plugin
2. A dumb user at PC Simulator Hacking community (ill not join it again as its unfriendly and dangerous, this is also why my alt got banned on PC Simulator even though I didnt chat on it.)
3. Someone found my Youtube video and reported it to the moderators

Message to Yiming:
Please lessen the restrictions about Rule 14, so that you wont get banned if you dont talk about cheating. This means that if you are popular in the hacking community, then you should not get banned for such thing, even though you didnt violate the rule.

So if you are at PCSim hecking community, or any server of PC Simulator hacking topic, please leave it. The Discord for this project is the only trusted one.
