<h1>Illegal items</h1>
In PC Simulator, normally you can only get items through the Daily Market, Print Expert, and Store.<br>
However, there are a few items that are normally unobtainable.
<h2>Hidden, but not illegal items</h2>
You can go to the Silk Road website to buy these stuff:
<h3>PUOIO Phone</h3>
It's just a phone. An iPhone.
<h3>Super Glue</h3>
This item makes the bonding between the 2 components infinitely strong. <br>
The only way you can remove them is to use the Remove Component tool.
<h2>Illegal items</h2>
<h3>Projector</h3>
An actual projector and it works as a display! All you have to do is to set this as the monitor for your PC.
Click the Monitor tool, select the projector, select the case.
<h3>RTX4080Ti</h3>
This was originally going to be implemented as a normal item, but it was too big to fit into computers and thus was made an illegal item.<br>
Plus, it gets a random score at benchmarks and mining.<br>
BTW, no Ti variant of the 4080 exists.
<h3>Pillow</h3>
Just a pillow.
<h3>Cube</h3>
Just a transparent wireframe cube.
<h2>Illegal items that are not discovered yet</h2>
<h3>Hydraulic press</h3>
Only shown in the 1.8.0 Trailer. Probably inserted into the code, recorded, then removed in the stable release.
