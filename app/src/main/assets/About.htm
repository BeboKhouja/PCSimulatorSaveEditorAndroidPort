<h2>About</h2>

PC Simulator Save Editor is a free, and open-source save editor for PC Simulator.<br><br>

The project was originally created after a user on the PC Simulator Discord shared a save editor. That's where I reverse engineered the apk, and recreated the decrypt and encrypt function in Java.<br><br>

Message which lead to the creation of the project: <br>
