<h1>PC Simulator websites</h1>

<strong>You may think the browser is limited, but it's not.</strong><br><br>

There are other websites you can visit.<br>
These can all be visited by clicking on the search bar, typing in one of these websites, and clicking the search button.<br><br>
<b>Examples</b><br><br>
<h2>Silk Road</h2><br>
<img src='SilkRoad.jpg' alt='Silk Road website'  style='height:30%;'/><br>
URL: <code>www.darknet.com</code><br><br>
Visiting this website will allow you to buy:<br><br>
PUOIO Phone<br>
Glue (Which if it touches attached components will add glue to it )<br><br>

All of these items are not considered illegal items because they are obtainable.<br><br>

<h2>Free Coins</h2><br>
<img src='FreeCoins.jpg' alt='Free Coins website' style='height:30%'/><br>
URL: <code>www.freecoins.com</code><br>
Visiting this website will give you $100000, but it won't.<br>
Don't try this on your main computer/save!<br>
Clicking the Claim button will 99% of the time cause the PC it's running on to blow up.<br>
However, if you are lucky, then you get $100000 coins.<br>

<h2>Giveaway</h2><br>
<img src='Giveaway.jpg' alt='Giveaway Website' style='height:30%'/><br>
URL: <code>www.giveaway.com</code><br>
Typing in something and then clicking Claim wont do anything, unless you use a special code from the PC Simulator Discord server. (Though they are all expired)<br><br>
<img src='GiveawayThankYou.jpg' alt='Giveaway website saying "Thank You"' style='height:30%'/><br>
However, not typing in something and clicking claim will give you this screen:<br>
<img src='GiveawayAlreadyClaimed.jpg' alt='Giveaway website saying that it has already been claimed' style='height:30%'/><br>
