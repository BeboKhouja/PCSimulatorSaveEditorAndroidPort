# Securing yourself from malware

## Check the permissions of the app

The app by design does not use any permission at all, even at the all permissions menu. If you notice a permission, it could be malware.

## Verify the hash of the app

On dev builds and releases, a hash is provided. If it matches one of those, then the app is safe.
